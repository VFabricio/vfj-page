<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello there! My name is Fabricio Juliatto. I'm a Software Developer, functional programming lover, former physicist and curious about all kinds of stuff. I've created this site to share my thoughts about programming topics and to show the projects I've been working on. If you want to contact me, feel free to do it via any of links on the left.</p>

<ul>
	<li>HTML5</li>
	<li>CSS3</li>
	<li>JavaScript (including Svelte/Sapper)</li>
	<li>C</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Clojure</li>
	<li>Haskell</li>
